        <p>WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE THE  PONDS? <br />
          <br />
        The area which is now the Straw's Bridge open space includes the site of   the old West Hallam Sewage Works. In the 1970's and 1980's open cast   mining was carried out. The company concerned got into financial   difficulties and although they had pledged to restore the site they were   unable to do so.</p>
        <p>Erewash Borough Council took it on and   began restoration and development of the site as a wildlife habitat and   local amenity. Since then it has become increasingly popular among both   locals and visitors from further&nbsp;afield. While this is a good thing it   means that there is a risk of conflict between the needs of visitors on   the one hand and the wildlife and its habitat on the other. This is one   reason behind the formation of the Friends of Straw's Bridge.
