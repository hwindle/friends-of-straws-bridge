			<p>Had an early morning stroll down to Straw&#39;s Bridge this morning (7 May, 2012). All was quiet on the main lake. The Canada Geese and Mute Swans were feeding and a few Mallards had chicks that were doing the same. No sign of the Common Sandpiper that had been reported a few days since. There were a couple of Tufted Ducks and a lone Great Crested Grebe. The Coot is still on the nest near the car park bless it! Plenty of Hirundines in the form of Swallows and house Martins were scudding over the water searching for flying insects to feed on. Some were collecting mud for nest building. In the meadow to the side of the lake a few Cowslips and Chickweed are emerging as are the first signs of Ragged robin and field vetches. As I left Straw&#39;s a single Common Tern flew over. Moving through to the rear ponds there was Blackcap calling and a few Coots on the water. Climbing the dam towards Peewit Carr the sound of Sedge Warblers singing came to the fore. There were Blackcap calling in Peewit Carr itself and more Cowslips emerging here too along with a wonderful little flock of Long Tailed Tits. On Manners there was the usual collection of Coots, Moorhens, Tufted Ducks, Mute Swans and Great Crested Grebe. The Grebes have two chicks and the parents are carrying them on their backs at present. Heard Dunnock, Blackbird, Song Thrush, Chaffinch and Blue Tit on the way back to Straw&#39;s Bridge.All in all not a bad morning.</p>

			<p>March 11 2012 - Latest Sightings by Paul Shaw</p>

			<p>Well what a day! We&#39;re off to Northumberland in May and if the weather is anything like it was today we&#39;ll be happy. Anyway, decided to shuffle of to Straw&#39;s Bridge early doors and see what was around. The mega highlight was an Otter on the bigger of the ponds behind Straw&#39;s. Only saw it surface once and then it disappeared. A search revealed no prints or any spraint so I assume it was moving along the Nutbrook (they&#39;ve been seen on here before) and diverted off the check the ponds. Top start to the day.</p>

			<p>If you go to Straw&#39;s you&#39;ll notice a raft of straw in the middle of the lake and some cages to the left.The straw is Barley and it&#39;s to stop the spread of blue-green algae. The cages are to protect new planting of marginal aquatic plants to make the area more diverse. The car parks having a make-over too. A big thanks to all from the friends group who helped yesterday and apologies for my absence.Anyway, back to today. Caught my first Meadow Pipet of the year over Manner floods and Blackcap singing at Straw&#39;s. Lots of other birds around.</p>
