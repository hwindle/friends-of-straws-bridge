          <h2>Fast Funding Success!</h2>
          <h5>7th June 2023 - Ruth Cornock</h5>
          <p>
            Earlier in the year, Ruth, one of the Friends group, saw an
            opportunity to apply for funding (up to the value of £500) towards
            projects that will improve the overall quality of life and wellbeing
            of residents in Erewash in line with the council's current Corporate
            Plan Priorities. The Friends group had been wanting to purchase a
            nesting platform to replace weather worn platforms that have
            deteriorated over time. We hope to have this platform installed in
            2024 during our next work morning, before the nesting season gets
            under way. We would like to express our sincere thanks to Erewash
            Borough Council for agreeing to fund this project, and for their
            continued support of the Friends group.
          </p>
          <h2>Blooming Marvellous!</h2>
          <h5>12th November 2022 - Ruth Cornock</h5>
          <p>
            The Friends of Straw's Bridge was recently awarded a Judge's Award
            as part of the East Midlands in Bloom competition. The East Midlands
            is one of 18 regions that make up Britain in Bloom, a campaign
            organised and run by the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS). The
            judge's award recognises
            <i
              ><q
                >the Friends of Straw's Bridge for their fundraising and hard
                work to improve the planting in many areas of the reserve, the
                installation of an inclusive picnic bench and their engagement
                with the public, especially in their many nature watching
                events</q
              ></i
            >. This contributes to the upholding of the three core RHS pillars
            of excellence consisting of Horticultural Achievement, Environmental
            Responsibility and Community Participation.

          <h2>New Website Launched!</h2>
          <h5>17th January 2022 - Ruth Cornock</h5>
          <p>
            We may not have been able to host our usual range of events during
            the last two years due to the Coronavirus crisis, but we have been
            able to undertake a much needed redevelopment of the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep checking back for news of forthcoming events and news from the
            reserve! We will continue to also use Facebook to publicise the
            reserve and work of the Friends Group.

          <h2>An Unusual Visitor!</h2>
          <h5>February 2021 - Ruth Cornock</h5>
          <p>
            Straw's Bridge was host to a very special visitor this month, with
            the sighting of a rare bird - a Slavonian Grebe! I was out on one of
            my regular lockdown runs, and as I ran along the Nutbrook Trail
            towards Manor Floods, I spotted a group of long lensed photographers
            and twitchers and so went to see what they had spotted. The grebe
            was first spotted on Pewit Carr, before moving on to the smaller of
            the Nutbrook Ponds. These rare birds are only spotted in Derbyshire
            once or twice a year and usually attract twitchers to wherever they
            are seen
          </p>
          <p>
            More information about the Slavonian Grebe can be found

          <h2>Greetings Cards</h2>
          <h5>20th September 2020 - Ruth Cornock</h5>
          <p>
            We have a lovely range of greetings cards available for sale. Photos
            taken by visitors to Straws Bridge, were chosen to feature in a
            range of high quality greetings cards. These cards are sold at
            events that the Friends attend &#163;1.50 each.
