            alt="The main pond at Straw's Bridge on a sunny day"

          <p>
            The area which is now the Straw's Bridge nature reserve includes
            the site of the old West Hallam Sewage Works. In the 1970's and
            1980's, open cast mining was carried out. The company involved
            got into financial difficulties and although they had pledged to
            restore the site, they were unable to do so.
          </p>

          <p>
            Erewash Borough Council took the site on and began restoration and
            development of the site as a wildlife habitat and local amenity.
            Since then it has become increasingly popular among both locals,
            amongst whom it is often referred to as &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and
            visitors from further afield. While this is a good thing, it means
            that there is a risk of conflict between the needs of visitors on
            the one hand and the wildlife and its habitat on the other. This is
            one reason behind the formation of the Friends of Straw's
            Bridge.

          <h2>About the Friends</h2>

          <p>
            The Friends of Straw's Bridge group was formed in 2010. It is a
            group of people who take an interest in promoting, developing and
            improving the site for both visitors and wildlife. We hold regular
            meetings and organise activities and events at Straw's Bridge
            throughout the year. If you would like to become a
            &quot;Friend&quot; or just find out more about the site please
            contact us via Facebook!
